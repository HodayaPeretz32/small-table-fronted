## 🚀 Overview

A WEB system that allows customers to order menus for small events in a simple and convenient way,
and for small businesses to offer their catering services without the need for an independent website or complex technical maintenance.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (Django)
- **Frontend:** React
- **DB:** SQL

## 🔧 Configuration

The `.env` file contains environment settings for the application.
You can customize them to your own needs.
All what you need to do is:

1. **Editing the .env File:** Find the `.env` file  which located in the main project directory and open it using a text editor of your choice.
2. **Environment Variables:** Find the specific key that you want to edit, and customize it's value.
For example, if you want to change the value of the `PORT` key to a different port (e.g. because you want to set your application run port), just change the value.
3. **Saving Changes:** Save the changes you made to the `.env` file after modifying the variables.
